- DESCRIPTION

---------------------------------------------------------------


This project was started so that a build tree and example library could be created that showed how 
to setup cross-platform Omnis externals with support for a version control system (such as 
Subversion, Git or Mercurial) and an automated build system.

If this example is used on a Mac, then a project can be simultaneously used by XCode and Visual 
Studio 2008 (in Parallels or VMWare) against the same set of source files (Important so development 
can occur in a single development environment, but builds can be made on all platforms).  Only 
additional source files need to be added to each project when changes occur.  Linux support is not 
available at this time.

It is required to download the SDK from TigerLogic in order to setup the build environment variables 
required for this project:

---------------------------------------------------------------

- DESCRIPTION OF FILES

---------------------------------------------------------------

../include/NVObjTemplate.he
../src/NVObjTemplate.cpp     : Main entry point for Omnis external.  These files control the dispatch of messages to appropriate non-visual objects and the definition of non-visual objects.

../include/NVObjBase.he
../src/NVObjBase.cpp    : These files hold the base class, NVObjBase, to be used for all non-visual objects.  It provides basic methods for defining a non-visual object.

../include/OmnisTools.he
../src/OmnisTools.cpp    : These files hold a series of helper methods that I've found useful while creating components.

../include/Simple.he
../src/Simple.cpp    : These files hold an example implementation of a non-visual object, Simple.  Simple has 1 property and 2 methods.  

../include/Static.he
../src/Static.cpp    : These files hold an example implementation of static methods.  There is 1 static method, $staticEmpty().

../src/NVObjTemplate.rc : This file holds the "resources" -- string table for method, property, and constant descriptions -- that Omnis uses for the component.  (Resource 32000 is the name of the entry point method in NVObjTemplate.cpp)

../src/NVObjTemplate.def : This file holds the entry point name for Windows components (Should match resource 32000 in NVObjTemplate.rc)

- BUILD TREE

---------------------------------------------------------------



Windows and Mac projects are configured to look at directories within the "MyProjects" folder, so no
additional work should be required for compiling.  It's better to avoid spaces in paths as the Omnis 
build system doesn't properly recognize them.


Omnis External Dependencies:
-----------------------------
See "Read Before Compiling.txt" for instructions on setting up the OMNIS_LIB_PATH environment variable
$OMNIS_LIB_PATH/Mac       = Omnis external component dependencies for Mac (complib and frameworks folders)
$(OMNIS_LIB_PATH)/Windows = Omnis external component dependencies for Windows (COMPLIB, EXTLIB, and ULIBS folders)

Source Code Locations:
-----------------------------
include = Header fields for component NVObjTemplate
src     = Source files for component NVObjTemplate 
proj    = Platform dependant project files 


Project Locations:
-----------------------------
proj    = Platform dependant project files 


---------------------------------------------------------------

- BUILD OUTPUT

---------------------------------------------------------------


Debug / Development output puts the component in the Omnis Studio xcomp folder (See OMNIS DIRECTORY).


Release output puts the component in the deploy folder.
deploy/Mac/     = Mac component
deploy\Windows\ = Windows component 



---------------------------------------------------------------

- OMNIS DIRECTORY

---------------------------------------------------------------



The Omnis directory must be setup prior to compiling any debug versions of the external.  It is read 
from an Environment Variable, OMNIS_XCOMP_PATH.



For windows this is like: C:\TigerLogic\OS50\xcomp
- Set under System Properties (Access by Right-Clicking My Computer and then selecting Properties)
- Requires close and re-open of Visual Studio


For Mac this is like: HD:Applications:OmnisStudio:Contents:MacOS:xcomp
- Set in the environment.plist file in the user home directory ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist 
- Requires log off of OS X

---------------------------------------------------------------

- CUSTOMIZATION (How to change name from NVObjTemplate)

---------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously the purpose of any template is to get you started with creating your own components.  While 
renaming the classes can be a delicate process these are the things that I've found to be a good starting place.

All:
- Since many files are being renamed they may need to be re-added to the project.  Especially if you 
  rename on Mac and then open Windows project or vice-versa.

Mac: 
- Rename the NVObjTemplate.xcodeproj project file (while the project is closed)
- Rename NVObjTemplate.he and NVObjTemplate.cpp
- Perform a global find/replace for NVObjTemplate
- Perform a global find/replace for NV_OBJ_TEMPLATE_HE
- Rename NVObjTemplate.rc
- Rename NVObjTemplate.def

Windows:
- In Visual Studio, right-click on Solution and rename
- In Visual Studio, right-click on Project and rename
- Rename NVObjTemplate.he and NVObjTemplate.cpp
- Perform a global find/replace for NVObjTemplate
- Perform a global find/replace for NV_OBJ_TEMPLATE_HE
- Rename NVObjTemplate.rc 
- Rename NVObjTemplate.def
